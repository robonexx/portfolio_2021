# So started on a New portfolio

My goal is to try to use a lot of what i have learned the past year

# This will not be following best practices

I will Use both Styled Components for some components and also SCSS for pages and some other things

This might look messy for some, but My goal is to try to redo all that ive done earlier from styled components to SASS and vice versa. Also change fontawesome icons to both react icons or styled icons

# Lets see how this goes. :D 

- My project log
IÂ´ve pushed it up to surge to check how it looks. 
Will need to fix media queries as i go. 

- Next up fix, About, Projects and Contact pages
- Change from Styled components to SASS
